Face detection using firebase ML Kit in flutter

The goal of this project is to provide basic idea of Face Detection. I have used Firebase Face Detection modle API and tryed to detect faces and
show whats the emotional emoji of the detected face.
While I used Flutter MLKit for my own needs, but it's a basic and also intented to showcase good ML app structure and a clean, well-organized Flutter codebase.
